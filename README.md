# AGR2280
An open source Wipeout clone. FPS ARCADE CABINET EDITION

This is a simple modification of AGR2280 to run in an arcade cabinet like the one in Hackers with Crash & Burn's high scores entered in advance as benchmarks to beat.

This should work with any FPS controller by dropping the AGR2280ArcadeCabinet prefab into a scene and placing the ActivationCrosshair.cs script on the main camera.

It will detect FPS controllers and add this script for you if it finds it missing.
